# .gitignore file for Xcode4 and Xcode5 Source projects
#
# Apple bugs, waiting for Apple to fix/respond:
#
#    15564624 - what does the xccheckout file in Xcode5 do? Where's the 
documentation?
#
# Version 2.6
# For latest version, see: 
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/49478/git-ignore-file-for-xcode-projects
#
# 2015 updates:
# - Fixed typo in "xccheckout" line - thanks to @lyck for pointing it out!
# - Fixed the .idea optional ignore. Thanks to @hashier for pointing this 
out
# - Finally added "xccheckout" to the ignore. Apple still refuses to 
answer support requests about this, but in practice it seems you should 
ignore it.
# - minor tweaks from Jona and Coeur (slightly more precise xc* 
filtering/names)
# 2014 updates:
# - appended non-standard items DISABLED by default (uncomment if you use 
those tools)
# - removed the edit that an SO.com moderator made without bothering to 
ask me
# - researched CocoaPods .lock more carefully, thanks to Gokhan Celiker
# 2013 updates:
# - fixed the broken "save personal Schemes"
# - added line-by-line explanations for EVERYTHING (some were missing)
#
# NB: if you are storing "built" products, this WILL NOT WORK,
# and you should use a different .gitignore (or none at all)
# This file is for SOURCE projects, where there are many extra
# files that we want to exclude

# Xcode 4 - semi-personal settings
#
# Apple Shared data that Apple put in the wrong folder
# c.f. http://stackoverflow.com/a/19260712/153422
#     FROM ANSWER: Apple says "don't ignore it"
#     FROM COMMENTS: Apple is wrong; Apple code is too buggy to trust; 
there are no known negative side-effects to ignoring Apple's unofficial 
advice and instead doing the thing that actively fixes bugs in Xcode
# Up to you, but ... current advice: ignore it.
*.xccheckout

#
#
# OPTION 1: ---------------------------------
#     throw away ALL personal settings (including custom schemes!
#     - unless they are "shared")
# As per build/ and DerivedData/, this ought to have a trailing slash
#
# NB: this is exclusive with OPTION 2 below
xcuserdata/

# OPTION 2: ---------------------------------
#     get rid of ALL personal settings, but KEEP SOME OF THEM
#     - NB: you must manually uncomment the bits you want to keep
#
# NB: this *requires* git v1.8.2 or above; you may need to upgrade to 
latest OS X,
#    or manually install git over the top of the OS X version
# NB: this is exclusive with OPTION 1 above
#
#xcuserdata/**/*

#     (requires option 2 above): Personal Schemes
#
#!xcuserdata/**/xcschemes/*

####
# Xcode 4 workspaces - more detailed
#
# Workspaces are important! They are a core feature of Xcode - don't 
exclude them :)
#
# Workspace layout is quite spammy. For reference:
#
# /(root)/
#   /(project-name).xcodeproj/
#     project.pbxproj
#     /project.xcworkspace/
#       contents.xcworkspacedata
#       /xcuserdata/
#         /(your name)/xcuserdatad/
#           UserInterfaceState.xcuserstate
#     /xcshareddata/
#       /xcschemes/
#         (shared scheme name).xcscheme
#     /xcuserdata/
#       /(your name)/xcuserdatad/
#         (private scheme).xcscheme
#         xcschememanagement.plist

####
# Xcode 4 - Deprecated classes
#
# Allegedly, if you manually "deprecate" your classes, they get moved 
here.
#
# We're using source-control, so this is a "feature" that we do not want!

*.moved-aside

####
# OPTIONAL: Some well-known tools that people use side-by-side with Xcode 
/ iOS development
#
# NB: I'd rather not include these here, but gitignore's design is weak 
and doesn't allow
#     modular gitignore: you have to put EVERYTHING in one file.

You shouldn't be ignoring *.lock or Podfile.lock (never mind the 
redundancy). You want the exact same versions installed in all workspaces, 
you don't want the "latest version". –

I have removed the Podfile part. I didn't add that originally, SO says 
someone else added it and I carelessly copy/pasted it into the gist. My 
apologies for any/all confusion and misunderstanding. I really dislike the 
way StackOverflow lets anyone edit your answers :(. –

There's now an explanation line for EVERYTHING, line by line. This should 
make it much clearer, and make it easier to customize for your own 
projects. –

@Adam As I can see, this file contains VCS metadata, and should therefore 
not be checked into the VCS. No, there no mentions on developer.apple.com 
about xccheckout. But on official github page, this file included already 
in the gitignore file.

Without official description, we're not going to ignore anything. Almost 
every time people have done that, it's corrupted someone's project sooner 
or later. Way too dangerous - don't go there. So I refuse to add anything 
to this file unless I have a verifiable source confirming it is safe to 
ignore! –

Most of the answers are from the Xcode 4-5 era. I recommend an ignore file 
in a modern style.
